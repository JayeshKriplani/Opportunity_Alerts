**Demand-based Notification Platform for Course and Job Opportunities**

📌 _Project Description_ :

"Demand-based Notification Platform for Course and Job Opportunities" is a web-based platform designed to address the challenge of missing out on personalized career opportunities. The system aims to provide a tailored notification system that delivers timely updates about job openings and courses based on the individual’s interests and preferences. Unlike existing platforms that often send generalized updates, this system ensures that users receive information that is most relevant to their specific career goals or educational aspirations.

The platform will allow users to set preferences for types of jobs or courses they are interested in, and it will automatically notify them when opportunities matching their preferences arise. This reduces the chance of missing out on opportunities and helps users stay ahead in their career or education journey.

💻 _Problem Statement_:

Individuals frequently miss out on opportunities for courses or jobs due to the absence of a personalized notification system that caters to their specific interests.
Existing platforms often provide generalized updates, lacking the capability to match user preferences accurately. This results in inefficiencies, missed deadlines, and lost potential for career growth.

There is a pressing need for a system that identifies user demands, tracks relevant opportunities, and delivers timely notifications to ensure users are always informed and ready to act. This platform addresses this gap by notifying users of course or job opportunities that match their demands.

👉🏻 Personalized Notifications: Get notified when a course or job opportunity matches your set preferences.
